# YAMKC - Yet Another Mario Kart Clone
## Description
YAMKC is a clone of a Mario Kart game for Windows using OpenGL. This project was made for a computer graphics course, where I had to develop a racing game using OpenGL as the graphics engine. Appart from OpenGL/freeglut as the graphics engine, and freeimage as the image loading library, the rest of the code is made by me.

This game was made with the intention to mimic the feeling of a Mario Kart game, using Mario Kart 7 as the inspiration. I had limited time to accomplish this (about 2 weeks), so I had to focus on the basic behaviour (rendering and kart physics, basically). I doubt this game will get further development, it all depends if enough people want it finished or not.

Feel free to use the code and ideas in this repository for your own games! (Check the [License](LICENSE.md) for full terms.)

You can check the following [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/bqOL-XtQ2Nk) showcasing the v0.1 version of the game.
